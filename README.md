# comments-server
Simple node server built with the Koa framework to a RAML specification to validate autogenerated client.
This server works ~~best~~ **only** with Node v7 and above.

Running this server is as simple as ABC:

```bash
A$ git clone https://github.com/wizzy25/comments-server.git

B$ npm install

C$ npm start
```
And that's it. You're now serving wonderful comments ðŸ˜Ž

As an experimental server, there is no database! This just mocks it all ðŸ™ƒ
